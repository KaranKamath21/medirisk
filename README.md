# MediRisk

MediRisk is a cutting-edge Flutter application designed to empower users with a holistic approach to health management. Leveraging advanced technologies, the app comprises three distinctive components, each addressing crucial aspects of healthcare. The first component employs a deep learning model based on neural networks to predict diseases accurately by analyzing user-input symptoms. This model, compiled into a TensorFlow Lite model, boasts an impressive accuracy of near 100%. The second component focuses on mental health analysis, utilizing an interactive quiz to provide users with insights into their psychological well-being. Lastly, the third component records and monitors usersâ€™ past medical history, particularly emphasizing respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. The integration of real-time environmental data through the OpenWeather API enables the app to deliver timely alerts and notifications, ensuring users stay informed about potential health risks based on current weather conditions.
